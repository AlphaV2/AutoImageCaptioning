**🖼️ AutoImageCaptioning**

AutoImageCaptioning is a simple yet efficient image captioning system that generates textual descriptions for images using the BLIP (Bootstrapping Language-Image Pretraining) model. It is designed to be lightweight, requiring minimal storage and computation, making it ideal for beginners and small-scale projects.

🚀 Features
✅ Automatic Caption Generation – Generate meaningful captions for images.

✅ BLIP Model – Uses the Salesforce/blip-image-captioning-base model for high-quality captions.

✅ Optimized for Efficiency – Runs smoothly on CPU/GPU with minimal computational overhead.

✅ Minimal Dependencies – Requires only torch, transformers, and PIL for execution.

✅ Beginner-Friendly – Simple and easy to integrate into any project.

🛠️ Installation
To use this model, install the required dependencies using: BASH
pip install torch torchvision transformers pillow

📸 Usage
1️⃣ Import & Load the Model: python
from caption_generator import generate_caption

2️⃣ Generate a Caption for an Image: python

caption = generate_caption("your_image.jpg")
print("Generated Caption:", caption)

📂 Project Structure: 

AutoImageCaptioning/
│── caption_generator.py  # Core Python script for caption generation  
│── test.jpg              # Sample image (replace with your own)  
│── README.md             # Project documentation

🎯 How It Works
1️⃣ The script loads an image and preprocesses it.
2️⃣ The BLIP model generates a textual description of the image.
3️⃣ The output caption is printed or stored for further use.

🏗️ Future Improvements
🔹 Optimize the model for lower latency and memory usage.
🔹 Add support for batch processing of multiple images.
🔹 Implement a simple web interface for easy image uploads.
🔹 Explore fine-tuning the model for domain-specific captioning.
